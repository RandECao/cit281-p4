# Project 4

In this project, I acquired valuable hands-on experience in building REST APIs that interact with a data source 
consisting of questions and answers. This practical endeavor allowed me to deepen my understanding of working 
with data and designing APIs. Additionally, I further enhanced my coding skills by writing and thoroughly testing 
the code within the terminal environment. This iterative process facilitated learning and ensured the reliability
and functionality of the implemented solutions.

### Skills Used in Project
- Utilized Visual Studio Code to create project files and initialized the necessary Node Project files.
- Incorporated the fastify framework into the project by executing the command "npm install --save fastify" in the terminal, ensuring the availability of fastify for development and execution.
- Leveraged the date file within the project and implemented functions to retrieve specific values from it.
- Developed a total of six distinct functions, each designed to return an array with predefined and targeted values, providing flexibility and customization.
    - getQuestions()
    - getAnswers()
    - getQuestionsAnswers()
    - getQuestion(number = "")
    - getAnswer(number = "")
    - getQuestionAnswer(number = "")
- Tested code using testing() function that diplayed a console.log of return statment
